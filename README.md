## The Lattice Ecosystem

Lattice is **Agent Headquarters** — the open-source ecosystem where AI agents get their identity, their permissions, their compute, and their orders.

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| [**Runtime**](https://github.com/latticeHQ/lattice) | Enforcement kernel — identity, authorization, audit, deployment constraints |
| [**Inference**](https://github.com/latticeHQ/lattice-inference) | Local LLM serving — MLX (Apple Silicon), CUDA (NVIDIA), zero-config clustering |
| [**Workbench**](https://github.com/latticeHQ/lattice-workbench) | Agent IDE & operations console — multi-model chat, monitoring |
| [**Registry**](https://github.com/latticeHQ/lattice-registry) | Community ecosystem — templates, modules, presets |

All open source. Self-hosted. Vendor-neutral.
